# Recursive version of Floyd-Warshall algorithm

**Summary**

This repository includes a recursive version of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, which finds the shortest path between all pairs of nodes in a graph.

**Requirements**

The requirements to run the algorithm can be found in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/rvserna/CSCK541_floyd_recursive/blob/main/requirements.txt).

**Usage**

The [floyd_recursive](https://github.com/rvserna/CSCK541_floyd_recursive/blob/main/floyd_recursive.py) algorithm can be used to find the shortest distance for graphs with any number of vertices. The example graph contains 4 vertices.

**Testing**

Included within this repository are a set of unit and performance tests. These tests validate the algorithm against expected outputs and measure its execution time as well as memory usage. For more information, please review the examples within the [tests folder](https://github.com/rvserna/CSCK541_floyd_recursive/tree/main/tests).

The recursive algorithm was tested against the following algorithms to compare performance:
